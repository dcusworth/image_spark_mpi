# Parallelized Image Recognition in Spark + MPI

Image recognition is a hot topic in machine learning communities. Our project is to apply statistical learning theory in the Spark framework to classify images. We further aim to optimize the training of our learning algorithm by implementing MPI parallelization. We will explore both model and data parallelization as many examples of labeled images are critical to training an accurate model. We will start with a common dataset of handwritten digits (MNIST), and will set up a framework where custom images can be imported. 

Our project has the following objectives:
- Implement both serial and Spark regularized statistical learning algorithms. This will initially take the form of a linear classifier (e.g. 1-layer neural network) with L-2 loss.
- Optimize training through MPI parallelization.
- Analyze and benchmark data vs. model parallelization approaches. Weigh the benefits of computation cost vs. testing accuracy.
- Build a framework where custom images can be imported.

The project will presented in the form of a report, website, and presentation.
